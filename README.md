The official implementation for the paper [CAT: A Unified Click-and-Track Framework for Realistic Tracking] (ICCV2025)

We thank the community for the interest in our work. Recently, we have received several inquiries regarding the testing code. As the codebase is still under preparation, we have previously shared unpolished testing code and model checkpoints with some researchers during discussions. If testing is needed, please feel free to contact the authors via the email: 15716608638@mail.dlut.edu.cn. We will release the complete training code and documentation publicly once they are fully organized.
